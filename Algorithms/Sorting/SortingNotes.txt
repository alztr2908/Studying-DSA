Bubble Sort
    for i in 0..nums:
        for j in 0..len(nums)-i-1:
            swap(nums[j], nums[j+1]) if nums[j] > n
    
    second loop has a dynamic range of len(nums)-i-1: 
        minus i because at the end of every iteration, 
        the last place of nums is already sorted so no
        need to access it

        minus 1 because we are comparing nums[j] and nums[j+1]
        if there is no minus 1 there then it will result to index 
        out of bounds when i = len(nums)
