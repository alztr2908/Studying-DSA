Queue: is a linear data structure which models real world queues by having two primary operations: enqueue and dequeue

LIFO: last in, first out
Enqueue: add data to the last of the queue (queue back) 
Dequeue: remove (polling) data from the beginning of the queue (queue front)

Application:
    - model a real world queue like a lineup at movie theater
    - can be used to efficiently keep track the most recenly added elements
    - web server request management where first come first serve
    - BFS

Complexity Analysis:
    - Enqueue -> O(1) [Add tail]
    - Dequeue -> O(1) [Add head]
    - Peeking -> O(1) [Queue front]
    - Contains -> O(n)
    - Removal -> O(n)
    - IsEmpty -> O(1)
