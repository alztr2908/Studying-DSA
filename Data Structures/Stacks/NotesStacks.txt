Stack: one-ended linear data structure which models a real world stack by having two primary operations: push and pop. 

There is a top pointer that tracks and can be manipulated by push and pop operations

LIFO: Last In, First Out

When and where is a stack used?
    - used by undo mechanisms in text editors
    - used in compiler syntax checking for matching brackets and braces
    - can be used to model a pile of books or plates
    - used behind the scenes to support recursion by keeping track of previous function calls
    - can be used to do a DFS on a graph

Complexity of operations:
    - pushing => O(1)
    - popping => O(1)
    - peeking => O(1)
    - searching => O(n)
    - size => O(1)

sllStack methods:
    - size
    - isEmpty
    - push
    - pop
    - peek
